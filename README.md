# Stella-Ancilla
Artificial Intelligence based upon Foreunner Ancilla's

This was a fun project I did based on the Halo book Forerunner series.  The Ancilla's(AI's) that the forerunners used 
basically just accumulated information and sorted through it when you requested them too.  Most were far more advanced than this
but it is a start to what could be a complex project.

This Ancilla (AI) sorts through plain english requests for information.  Like you can ask her for the definition of a word, synonym for
a word etc.  If she can't find it in the dictionary then she will search the definition in a book.  This is to be extended to 
more information.  This is also in command line to make it a bit simpler.  So this is a little like having a local version of
a very basic Google.  Also the dictionary and theosaurus are pretty old so some definitions might not come up.
